After successful installation of Crab Server, we need to setup different crontab as user crab and root.

For user Crab:

	- Login to the Crab Server as user 'crab'
	- CVS checkout the COMP/ANALYSISOPS/CrabServer/integration from the repository
	- Move all the script files  COMP/ANALYSISOPS/CrabServer/integration to /home/crab/integration directory
	- Move  COMP/ANALYSISOPS/CrabServer/integration/crontab.dat file to /home/crab
	-Seup crontab by using command
	   crontab < crontab.dat

For user root:
	- Login to the Crab Server as user 'root'
	- Move  COMP/ANALYSISOPS/CrabServer/integration/ForRoot/crontab.dat file to /root
	- Seup crontab by using command
	   crontab < crontab.dat
